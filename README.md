Virtual Machine set up
Objective:
To simulate a secure, real-world environment for offensive and defensive testing using Kali Linux and Windows 10 virtual machines.
Tools Used:
-----------
- VirtualBox (Type 2 hypervisor)
- Kali Linux ISO
- Windows 10 ISO 
Steps:
------
1. *Installed VirtualBox* on host system (Windows/Linux)
2. *Created and configured Kali VM:*
   - OS: Kali Linux (latest)
   - RAM: 2 GB
   - Storage: 20 GB dynamically allocated
   - Network: Internal Network (named "LabNet")
3. *Created and configured Windows 10 VM
   - OS: Windows 10 Pro or Home
   - RAM: 2 GB
   - Storage: 20 GB dynamically allocated
   - Network: Internal Network (same name as Kali)
4. *Verified network isolation:*
   - No internet access
   - Both VMs connected only to each other
5. *Set static IPs:*
   - Kali: 192.168.1.101
   - Windows: 192.168.56.103
   - Subnet mask: 255.255.222.2
6. *Ping Test:*
   - Successfully pinged Windows from Kali
   - Successfully pinged Kali from Windows
7. *Tested Shared Folder Access:*
   - Enabled guest additions on Kali
   - Created shared folder to exchange files (optional)
8. *Service Enumeration (Optional):*
   - From Kali, used nmap 192.168.56.103 to scan Windows open ports
Result:
--------
A fully isolated and connected cybersecurity test lab ready for penetration testing and malware simulation.

QUESTION 3
FIREWALL 

# Virtual Firewall Lab (pfSense)
This lab simulates a basic firewall using pfSense to route and filter traffic between Kali Linux and Windows 10 virtual machines. It includes network configuration, DHCP setup, firewall rules, and logging in.

Features
- pfSense virtual firewall with WAN and LAN interfaces
- DHCP server enabled on LAN
- ICMP firewall rule for ping testing
- Verified routing between Kali ‚Üî Windows
- Screenshots are included
## üìÅ Folder Structure

Virtual Firewall Lab ‚Äì pfSense 
To simulate a secure virtual firewall setup using pfSense to route and inspect network traffic between Kali Linux (attacker) and Windows 10 (target).
Tools Used:
------------
- VirtualBox
- pfSense ISO
- Kali Linux VM
- Windows 10 VM
- Firefox
Steps Taken:
-------------
1. *Created a new pfSense VM in VirtualBox*
   - Added two network adapters:
     ‚Ä¢ Adapter 1 (WAN): Attached to NAT
     ‚Ä¢ Adapter 2 (LAN): Attached to Internal Network (named "LabNet")
2. *Installed pfSense using default options*
   - Set LAN IP: 192.168.56.1/24
   - Skipped WAN setup in the browser interface
3. *Accessed pfSense GUI from Kali*
   - Assigned Kali IP: 192.168.100.101
   - Opened browser and visited https://192.168.56.103
4. *Enabled DHCP on pfSense LAN interface*
   - Range: 192.168.56.100 ‚Äì 192.168.100.200
5. *Connected Windows 10 VM to the same Internal Network*
   - Received IP via DHCP: 192.168.100.53
6. *Created a firewall rule in pfSense*
   - Allowed ICMP protocol to enable ping between machines
7. *Tested communication*
   - Kali pinged Windows and pfSense successfully
   - Windows pinged pfSense and Kali successfully
8. *Monitored logs*
   - Went to Status > System Logs > Firewall
   - Verified that ping (ICMP) traffic was being logged
Result:
--------
The pfSense firewall successfully controlled and monitored traffic between Kali and Windows, simulating a real-world network security layer.
